TOP describes this project as deconstructing an existing webpage and rebuilding it. I have completed the Free Code Camp html/CSS courses, but my memory of that is: there are a bunch of selectors and command and properties. I have a feeling that I will spend most of my time in this project looking these up from other sources. Which, I suppose, is a good thing.

So, here we go.
